For a cleaner, more extensible design with better color support\r\nand compression, look up PNG.\r\n\r\ngiflib provides code for reading GIF files and transforming them into \r\nRGB bitmaps, and for writing RGB bitmaps as GIF files.\r\n\r\nThe (permissive) open-source license is in the file COPYING.\r\n\r\nYou will find build instructions in build.asc\r\n\r\nYou will find full documentation of the API in doc/ and on the \r\nproject website.\r\n\r\nThe project has a long and confusing history, described in history.asc\r\n\r\nThe project to-do list is in TODO.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
